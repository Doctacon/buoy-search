# Buoy v0.3.0 Changelog Integration

## What was observed

PR #26 (`work/finalize-buoy-v0-3-0-changelog -> develop`) was independently reviewed and merged by squash as `ef7b554239d2399745c1ac33f9b7055fa8dd3cd0` on 2026-07-16. Its exact reviewed head was `4f95a682b684a91a449ec3d212fdecdd299d7efb`.

The exact-head pull-request checks passed:

- Python 3.11: `https://github.com/Doctacon/buoy-search/actions/runs/29540240952/job/87760748996`
- Python 3.13: `https://github.com/Doctacon/buoy-search/actions/runs/29540240952/job/87760748948`
- Build distributions: `https://github.com/Doctacon/buoy-search/actions/runs/29540240952/job/87760850767`

Remote and local `develop` resolved to `ef7b554239d2399745c1ac33f9b7055fa8dd3cd0` after integration. `CHANGELOG.md` on develop contains `## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-16`, the hosted v0.3.0 Release link, and `v0.3.0...HEAD` for Unreleased.

## Procedure

The dedicated integration session rechecked the five-file diff, independent review, current target branch, and required checks before selecting the task-flow squash merge. It then fetched and fast-forwarded local develop and inspected the resulting changelog.

## What this supports

This satisfies the final child requirement that changelog finalization land through a separately reviewed, passing task PR and resolves the last aggregate parent acceptance criterion.

## Limits

This evidence concerns develop integration only. The published v0.3.0 tag remains correctly tied to release main before this post-release changelog commit; the changelog follow-up is intentionally unreleased source for the next release lineage.
