# Website Exact-Host Crawl Boundary Implementation Evidence

## What was observed

Current Buoy exact-host enforcement was implemented without a live or external-network crawl. Focused local fixtures used two loopback HTTP servers and proved:

- sibling-subdomain, external-host, protocol-relative, OAuth-shaped, chained, and open-redirect destinations were rejected before the destination path received a request;
- a same-host redirect to a different port continued, confirming port is not hostname identity;
- same-host one-hop, multi-hop, and exactly-20-hop redirects completed, while the 21st destination in an over-limit chain received zero requests;
- a robots-denied same-host target received zero requests, including when reached through a same-host redirect;
- same-host sitemap and robots redirects continued, while off-host robots/sitemap declarations, page declarations, child sitemaps, and redirect targets received zero destination requests;
- the pre-crawl sitemap-policy analysis path applied the same declaration and per-hop redirect checks;
- an unexpected off-host final response was rejected;
- JSON and text summaries exposed only `blocked_discovery_count` and `blocked_redirect_count`, with blocked link destinations removed from summary previews and no fixture query/credential values present.

## Procedure

1. Ran focused crawler tests under locked Python 3.11:
   `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --python 3.11 python -m unittest tests.test_crawler tests.test_crawler_exact_host -q`
2. Ran the full non-live suite under locked Python 3.11:
   `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --python 3.11 python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -q`
3. Repeated focused and full suites under locked Python 3.13.
4. Built wheel and source distribution outside the repository:
   `uv build --out-dir /tmp/buoy-exact-host-dist`
5. Ran Python compilation, `git diff --check`, and a static search for blocked URL/query-bearing output fields.
6. Pushed commit `1b64bc3`, opened PR #42, and observed GitHub Actions run `29696972955` to completion.

## Validation results

- Python 3.11 focused: 46 tests passed.
- Python 3.11 full: 418 tests passed.
- Python 3.13 focused: 46 tests passed.
- Python 3.13 full: 418 tests passed.
- Build: `buoy_search-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl` and `buoy_search-0.3.0.tar.gz` built successfully under `/tmp/buoy-exact-host-dist`.
- Compilation and whitespace checks passed; the static blocked-detail field search returned no matches.
- Hosted CI passed: Python 3.11 (43s), Python 3.13 (39s), and distribution build (11s).

## What this supports

This supports the executable ticket's implementation and local-validation acceptance criteria. It does not provide independent review or ticket closure.

## Limits

- Fixtures contacted loopback servers only; no live site, model, Turbopuffer service, or other remote service was used.
- Independent review remains a separate gate; this evidence does not review or close the ticket.
- Scrapling integration necessarily uses its current spider lifecycle hook to replace the robots fetch callback so redirected robots remain enforced while automatic client redirects are disabled.
